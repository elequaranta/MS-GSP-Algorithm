# MS-GSP from-scratch implementation

## Context:
**Class**: Data Mining and Text Mining, University of Illinois at Chicago (Fall 2023)

*1st year of Master's Degree in Computer Science coursework*

## Abstract: 
The goal of the assignment was to implement a modified version of the GSP algorothm (Generalized Sequential Pattern algorithm) allowing to assign each item a different minimum support value.
This generalization of the GSP mining algorithm takes as input a collection of sequences, where each sequence is defined as a list of *ordered* itemsets, and a parameter specification file containing the different minsup values for the items.
The output is a collection of frequent sequential patterns, organized by length. 



## Files: 
- main.py contains the full code to run the algorithm;
- data.txt contains sample input data;
- para.txt contains the minsup values settings for each item;
- results.txt contains sample output data.
